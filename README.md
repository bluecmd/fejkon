# fejkon

fejkon is a basic host bus adapter (HBA) for Fibre Channel (and thus, FICON) implemented on the DE5-Net board.
The aim is to provide easy access to add or consume Fibre Channel services, such as FCP or FICON
from an ordinary server.

Fejkon, which was born out of the need for a fake FICON HBA, is a Swedish pun playing on the word "fejk" which
translates "fake". It is pronounced similarly to the "FIC" in "FICON".

## Board

Target board right now is the DE5-Net from Terasic. They are available for $300 - $600 on eBay as of this writing
and are capable of implementing 4x 8 Gbit/s Fibre Channel ports on a PCIe Gen 3 x8 port.
